Nori started as a hobby project, born from my love for gaming communities and software development. What began as a simple Discord bot has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and services, driven by community feedback and continuous learning. The project represents both my journey as a developer and my passion for creating useful tools for player communities.

> A comprehensive suite of tools and services, featuring Discord/Kook integration, web interfaces, and public APIs.
